## InterestingJS 

This repo will contain random different interesting websites HTML / JavaScript / CSS and possibly some TypeScript source code for further personal analysis. 
Probably will have malicious code / phishing sites / scam attempts.

And also legitimate miscellaneous stuff I like to explore such as internal:
- ```edge://``` content, some from ```edge://edge-urls```
- ```chrome://``` content, some from ```chrome://chrome-urls```
- ```devtools://``` content
- ```chrome-extension://``` content
